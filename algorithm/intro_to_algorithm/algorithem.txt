## Asymptotic analysis 
Asymptotic analysis is a method that allows algorithms to be compared independently
of a particular programming language or hardware. 
With this method we can conclude, some algorithms are more efficient than others.

## Binary search
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
